                <p class= "group-text" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">Jenny, Ciera, Olivia, Maya and Alaine all met at a Girls Who Code camp during the summer of 2017 in Austin, TX, but are from a mix of Austin, Red Rock, Pflugerville and even Chicago. Even though we just met as a group for two weeks we worked well together, always having fun while making sure to get work done. We will continue to keep in touch after the camp is over! One piece of advice we want young female programmers to know is to not feel discouraged if Girls Who Code is your first exposure to Computer Science, because it’s never too late to explore!
